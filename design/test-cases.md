## Simple cases

- For the query "Estimate the effective reproduction number", we expect EpiNow2,
EpiEstim and R0 in the top 5 results.

- For the query "Build an SIR model", we expect odin, maybe pomp and shinySIR in
the top 5 results.

- For the query "Build an endemic channel", we expect epiCo in the top 3 results.

- For the query "Estimate the case fatality ratio of a new pathogen", we expect
cfr, coarseDataTools and maybe EpiNow2 in the top 5 results.

- For the query "Forecast new cases of Covid-19 in the next two weeks", we 
expect EpiNow2 in the top 5 results.

## Complex cases

- For the query "Determine the optimal way to distribute vaccine doses", we
would like to get finalsize, odin, pomp.

- For the query, "Estimate the dispersion parameter of an outbreak", we would
like to get bpmodels or modelSSE.
